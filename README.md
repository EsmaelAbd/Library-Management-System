# LMS
A Library Management Sytem that was built in laravel framework to manage books, authors, and users of the library.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
you can start by entering this command line:
```git
git clone https://github.com/EsmaelAbd/Library-Management-System
```

this code fetches all the data from the remote repository, which includes all files, branches, tags, and commits.
after that you need to enter the project file by writing this code:

```git
cd Task9
```

once you are in you can type the command:
```php
composer install
```
this command sets up the project's dependencies as per the project's locked-in or specified versions.

after that you need to create the .env file by copying the .env.example with this command:
```php
cp .env.example .env
```

finally you need to type the command:
```php
php artisan key:generate
```
and now you are good to go.
